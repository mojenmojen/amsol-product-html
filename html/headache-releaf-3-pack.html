            Headache ReLeaf Roll-On is a fast-acting migraine treatment and headache remedy. All-herbal and 100% organic, Headache ReLeaf comes in a pocket-size bottle with a rollerball applicator. It’s the perfect way to stop any throbbing headache in only seconds.
            Perfect for migraines, and an all-natural remedy for stress and tension headaches. Use it when headaches accompany a fever, a cold or the flu. Great for hormone headaches in women and men. Helps relieve hangover headache. Rely on it when allergy
            headaches strike, whether they are caused by pets, dust or environmental contaminants. Even soothes headache pain after over-exertion at the gym, outdoors or around the house.<br />
            <br /> Headache ReLeaf contains imported menthol, one of the world’s fastest-acting herbal pain relievers. Menthol lets you take advantage of an important medical fact: the human brain can process only one new sensory message at a time. By
            replacing throbbing headache signals with equally intense alternatives (initially a rejuvenating cool sensation followed by deep, soothing warmth), menthol interrupts the brain’s perception of pain. And based on the modern science of aromatherapy,
            Headache ReLeaf also includes three essential oils that have been used for centuries to relieve headache and migraine pain: peppermint, lavender and rose.

                <strong>How do the essential oils help? </strong><br /> Naturopaths worldwide use essential oils to restore balance to the body, mind and emotions. This approach is based on the assumption that your body is naturally in a state of balance.
                Headaches and migraines occur when that balance is disrupted by poor habits or illness. When the proper oils (combined in proper proportion) are applied to the skin, they get absorbed through your pores and pass quickly into your blood
                stream, traveling first to superficial muscle tissue and joints, then down into deeper tissue. It’s there that they work to restore balance and treat the root cause of your headache pain. While there are dozens of oils that offer health
                benefit, the most useful essential oils can be narrowed down to only a few dozen – offering you a new kind family-friendly medicine cabinet for treating everyday health problems.

                <strong>What’s wrong with over-the-counter pain relievers? </strong><br /> Used only occasionally, over-the-counter products are fairly harmless. Nevertheless, more than 16,500 Americans die every year from overuse of these "non-steroidal
                anti-inflammatory drugs" (which include aspirin, ibuprofen and indomethacin). Another 103,000 are hospitalized annually for complications from products they probably bought at the grocery store to combat headache pain or to offer migraine
                pain relief. Research proves that these over-the-counter pain relievers increase your risk for serious health problems, including high blood pressure, stomach and intestinal bleeding, ulcers and liver problems.
