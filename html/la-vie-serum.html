                <strong>What is La Vie en C Moisturizing Facial Soap? </strong><br />La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum is a highly-concentrated blend of vitamins, antioxidants and nutrients that improve skin appearance with just a single application.
                By creating an ultra-sheer barrier against damaging environmental contaminants, it helps protect facial tissue. And by incorporating gentle moisturizing botanicals, it helps keep skin looking healthy, bright and youthful. Every bottle
                of this sheer liquid-gel is manufactured exclusively in small batches, under the strictest quality-control standards, and contains a handmade blend of all-natural ingredients.

            <p id="whoshould">
                <strong>Is the Serum actually different from a moisturizer?</strong><br /> Yes! Far more concentrated than a moisturizing cream or lotion, La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum blends ultra-active skin nutrients that can bring faster
                and more effective results than a finishing moisturizer. Plus, it is formulated entirely without greasy or oily ingredients. So it never leaves that sticky feeling or glossy shine associated with traditional moisturizers. Applied after

            <p id="howoften">
                <strong>How does the product actually work?</strong><br /> At the center of the formula’s remarkable activity is a new breakthrough in skincare science: “stabilized vitamin C” (as ascorbic acid). Dermatologists and aestheticians have known
                for years that vitamin C could diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production, and improve the skin’s texture and elasticity. The problem has been an inability to keep vitamin C fresh and active for more
                than a few weeks. La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum has overcome that barrier, offering long-lasting facial hydration and protection. Additional benefits come from the infusion of powerful antioxidants and nutrients like rosehip
                fruit extract, xi xian cao, Mexican arnica and chamomile extract. It also contains both tamanu and jojoba oils, which keep skin well-hydrated and radiant.

                <strong>Who can benefit from using the Serum?  </strong><br />Women and men of all ages can improve their complexion with daily use of the serum. This science-based formula helps boost collagen production and feeds the skin without leaving
                a residue that can clog pores. Keeps young skin looking great for as long as possible. Also perfect for mature skin. Decreases the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Smooths facial skin tone. Lightens under-eye darkness and age spots.
                Women find that it offers the look of a daily mini-lift, diminishing saggy skin and promoting elasticity. Men appreciate that it is a fast, no-fuss approach to male skincare. Fragrance-free, it soothes and hydrates their skin after shaving
                to prevent rash and razor burn. Also helps with acne-prone skin. Even ideal for people with eczema, psoriasis and other skin sensitivity issues.

            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>How often should I apply it? </strong><br />This liquid gel is highly concentrated, so it takes very little product to achieve the desired result. One application daily, before bed, may be enough for someone with young, non-problematic
                skin. For more mature or highly sensitive skin, or for a troubled complexion, it is best to apply twice a day, morning and night. Always begin by cleansing the face. Then gently rub 2-3 pumps of La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum
                between the hands and lightly patted onto face and neck.
            </p>

                <strong>What ingredients are in the Serum? </strong><br />La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum contains distilled Water, olive leaf extract, matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract, Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), organic vegetable
                glycerin, Rosa mosqueta (rosehip) fruit extract, Calophyllum inophyllum (tamanu) seed oil, Siegesbeckia orientali (xi xian cao) extract, jojoba oil, Heterotheca inuloides (Mexican arnica) extract, sesodium acrylate, sodium carbomer, sodium

            <p id="moisturizer">
                <strong>Should I apply a moisturizer after the Serum?</strong><br />Dry skin does need ample moisture. So it would be wise to add extra protective hydration with a daily moisturizer. Be careful to choose a chemical-free product. Wash face
                with La Vie en C Moisturizing Facial Soap. Immediately apply the Moisturizer Serum. Then allow 15 minutes for the serum to be fully absorbed before adding your moisturizer.

                "I have very sensitive and dry skin so I'm always skeptical about trying anything new on my face. I have to say La Vie En C did wonders to my skin! I’ve been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin feels moisturized, soft and healthy. I couldn’t be happier
                with the results!"<br />
                <br /> "Being able to see results in a short period of time was a big plus for me. My skin looked brighter the morning after I first used the Serum! After 2-3 weeks, I noticed that the lines right above my upper lip and on my forehead
                looked much softer."<br />
                <br /> "I use the Serum as an after-shave every day to avoid razor burn and small pimples on my chin and neck."<br />
                <br /> "La Vie en C is the only thing that touches my skin! Being an esthetician, I've tried so many product lines but nothing else competes with the purity of their ingredients or quality of skin results they deliver. The Facial Cleanser
                is my favorite! Leaves my skin feeling so clean but completed hydrated."<br />
                <br /> "After being a longtime devotee of a very expensive line of skincare, I was dubious about trying this less costly Moisturizer Serum. But my doubts are definitely gone! After a few weeks of using La Vie en C Serum, my skin is smoother,
                softer, and more nourished than ever. Thank you for improving my skin and saving me money. Hooray!"<br />
                <br /> "I have super sensitive skin, prone to eczema and general irritation. Even the celebrity creams will give me a rash or redness. Complicating matters is that I have very dry skin and my eyes are easily irritated by facial products.
                Over the years, I've tried several moisturizers to help with all this. It's been an unpleasant rollercoaster of buying expensive (sometimes outrageously expensive) products, only to give them away to friends because they just didn't work
                for me. Then, I discovered La Vie En C. I have been using this remarkable line of skincare products for over a year now, and I absolutely love it. I'm able to keep my skin clean and cared for, feeling moisturized and enriched, with just
                their Cleanser and Serum. Amazing stuff! They really have reduced the lines on my face. It's like a time machine in a bottle!"<br />
                <br /> "Now in my 80’s I went bald at a young age, years before sunblock was advised. I suffered numerous sunburns while golfing, lawn mowing, etc. and the last couple of years required surgery to remove several melanomas from my scalp.
                This left me with scarring and sandpaper rough skin. I’ve never been one for lotions or moisturizers, but my daughter urged me to try La Vie n C. Mostly to humor her, I did – but with amazing results. The scarring is now barely visible
                and my sandpaper skin now feels like a baby’s ----. I can hardly believe it myself."<br />
                <br /> "I LOVE both the Cleanser and Serum. I use them twice a day and they’ve definitely improved the texture of my skin and seem to have calmed my tendency toward redness. The fine lines around my mouth appear less pronounced and two
                small age marks on my check have definitely lightened. I can’t say enough good things. I’m hooked! Thanks so much!"<br />
                <br /> "I am a man in my 60's, and I have some wrinkles on my forehead and a little 'stress knot' between my eyebrows. This serum goes on smoothly in the morning, and dries relatively quickly. This is important because I don't want to
                have a big regimen everyday - I just wouldn't make time for it. I've noticed the horizontal lines in my forehead are reduced, and the stress knot also appears more relaxed. I am continuing to use the product and would recommend it as I
                am quite happy with the results so far."
