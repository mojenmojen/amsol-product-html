                <strong>What are "indoor allergens"?</strong><br /> They’re invisibly small protein particles shed by all living creatures Dust and dust mites are major culprits. So are "pet residuals" (like fur, dander, saliva, urine and feathers) that
                often activate cat allergy symptoms and provoke dog allergies. Even our own bodies produce these allergens, in the form of perspiration and dead skin cells which we shed continuously, day and night. That’s why a laundry care product is
                so crucial in winning the war against indoor allergies and asthma.
            </p>
            <p id="ingredients">
                <strong>What are the symptoms of indoor allergies?</strong><br /> The most common indoor allergy symptoms are like bad cold symptoms: puffy or red eyes, tearing and burning, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and upper respiratory congestion.
                Bad headaches and sinus pressure can also be symptoms. In more extreme cases, symptoms can also include itchy skin and rashes, shortness of breath, extreme exhaustion and even serious joint pain.
            </p>
            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>HWhat causes asthma & indoor allergies? </strong><br /> Frankly, there are many causes of indoor allergies. Scientists think that heredity plays a role. If both your parents have allergies, there’s a 50% chance you will, too. And
                you have a 25% chance if only one of your parents is allergic. Experts also think that prolonged exposure to high levels of allergens can eventually provoke allergies in anyone. That’s why people sometimes develop allergies later in life.
                Studies also show that healthy children living around high levels of dust mites and other indoor contaminants are 500% more likely to develop asthma. By removing these sticky allergens from clothing, bed sheets, towels and other washable
                fabrics, Easy Air Organic Laundry Rinse helps prevent problems before they start, and even lowers a child’s risk of developing asthma.
            </p>
            <p id="howlong">
                <strong>How common are indoor allergies?</strong><br /> Scientists report that over 60 million Americans have indoor allergies. The American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology reports that 10% of us need dust mite allergy relief.
                Pet allergies are also widespread. Dog allergies strike 1 in 7 of us. Another 1 in every 3 of us has a cat allergy. Researchers also say that you’re at greater risk for indoor allergies if you already have an outdoor allergy (like hay
                fever).

                <strong>How often should the Laundry Rinse be used?</strong><br /> Asthma and indoor allergy symptoms vary tremendously. Some people suffer only slightly; others live with extreme symptoms. You’ll know it’s time to use more Laundry Rinse

                "We ordered Easy Air for the first time shortly after my wife was diagnosed with a dust mite allergy. We'd already stripped the carpeting out of our house, purchased a mattress cover for the bed, cleaned the house and all our sheets in scalding hot water.
                But nothing compared to the relief she got from Easy Air."<br />
                <br /> "My doctor said I had to get rid of my cats. Instead I got rid of my doctor and tried Easy Air. Now I'm living almost symptom-free with my three stooges: Moe, Larry, and Curly."<br />
                <br /> "I purchase this product regularly just to be safe from mites. Even though I clean regularly, this product makes me feel more protected. Thank you."<br />
                <br /> "My house was literally making me sick. Thank heaven for Easy Air. It's given me back my life."<br />
                <br /> "My grandson couldn't even stay with me because his allergies would get so bad. Now I can spray and wash with Easy Air before he arrives and we don't have any problems."<br />
                <br /> "I've been using Easy Air Laundry Rinse for about a year. Every other anti-mite solution I tried produced an overpowering, toxic odor and regardless of what any of them cost, my wife would just throw them out as soon as she got
                a whiff. Easy Air has a mild fragrance. It is cost effective and it WORKS. For these reasons, I am a loyal fan of the product. Thanks."<br />
                <br /> "It got to where I thought we'd have to pick between my kids' dog and my health. Fortunately, with Easy Air we can have both!"<br />
                <br /> "It seemed like all my time was spent taking antihistamines, cleansing my sinuses, clearing my throat, blowing my nose and still trying to act like a normal person even though I was MISERABLE! Easy Air has made it a lot easier.
                Thanks."
                <br />
                <br /> "Long ago I had a conversation with the man who invented Easy Air. I was really impressed with his commitment to a natural approach to dust and pet allergy relief. I've been ordering right along because his products really do work."<br
                />
                <br /> "I ordered the first time thinking it would be just another rip-off. Instead, this stuff made a real difference. You guys obviously know what you're doing. Keep doing it."<br />
                <br /> "The worst thing about having allergies is that people think it's all in your head. What a relief to talk with your staff. They knew exactly what I was talking about! I always enjoy placing my orders because everybody there is so
                helpful."
                <br />
                <br /> "Easy Air really works! I have one tip, though. Tell your customers to treat their cars. I sprayed around my home and my daughter was doing great. Then we'd leave for school and by the time we got there, she was miserable again.
                Now I spray the car upholstery and she stays a lot more comfortable."<br />
                <br /> "I enjoy this natural approach. There are other products on the market, but I haven't found any that work this well without using harsh chemicals."<br />
                <br /> "No words can relate how grateful I am for these products. I really believe with all my heart that Easy Air will become a household name. We can give others many things, but no greater gift can be given than to help someone breathe
                in deeply for the first time in weeks or months. That's what Easy Air has given me."</div>
