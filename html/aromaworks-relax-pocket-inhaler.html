                <h3>Uses</h3>
                Include RELAX Pocket Inhaler in your essential oil medicine cabinet. The internal cotton spine comes soaked in pure essential oils. When you place the inhaler under your nostrils and breathe deeply, the oils’ microscopic molecules make contact with tiny
                olfactory nerve receptors inside your nostrils. Those receptors instantly relay the molecules to your limbic system, the brain’s command center for emotions and metabolic function. This is the principle behind the ancient healing art of
                aromatherapy. Individual results may vary.

            The combination of essential oils in AromaWorks RELAX Pocket Inhaler offers some adults and teens temporary relief from occasional anxiety, stress, and tension. Essential oils of Lemon, Orange and Bergamot can be used by aromatherapists to calm the nervous
            system, encourage more flexible attitudes, combat mental burnout, relieve self-doubt, and lift worry. Meanwhile, essential oils of Vanilla and Sandalwood are used to restore mental balance and counteract fear.<br />
            <br /> Inside this plastic inhaler is a cotton spine soaked in rich essential oils that soothe anxiety and calm nervous energy. Use it anytime you’re under pressure or feel burdened by responsibility. Place the inhaler below one nostril and
            inhale once or twice. Since your olfactory nerve receptors cannot cross from one side of the brain to the other, inhaling through your right nostril affects only your right brain. Experts know that each side of the brain affects different
            aspects of health and well-being. So you can maximize benefit by inhaling first through one nostril and then the other.<br />
            <br /> RELAX relieves stress and tension without making you sleepy or “fuzzy-brained.” It won’t interfere with professional performance or make you feel disconnected from your emotions. It simply balances your system and helps you to look
            at issues without becoming fretful. RELAX does contain essential oil of bergamot, which should not be used in large amounts during pregnancy. RELAX’s unique mix of lemon, orange, bergamot, vanilla and sandalwood is totally safe and extremely
            effective. All these ingredients are among the most popular essential oils, used around the world for treating minor, everyday health problems.

                <strong>How do you use Relax Pocket Inhaler? </strong><br /> It’s easy. You unscrew the cap, place the inhaler below one nostril and inhale once or twice. Since your olfactory nerve receptors cannot cross from one side of the brain to
                the other, inhaling through your right nostril affects only your right brain. Experts know that each side of the brain affects different aspects of health and well-being. So you can maximize benefit by inhaling first through one nostril
                and then the other.

            <p id="howoften">
                <strong>What exactly is aromatherapy? </strong><br /> Essential oil aromatherapy is an ancient healing art that uses botanical sap (extracted from blossoms, leaves, bark and roots) to restore balance to the body, mind and emotions. It
                is based on the premise that your body’s natural state is balance. Illness or upset occur when that balance is disrupted by poor lifestyle habits or a contaminant. Among its many benefits, aromatherapy has been scientifically shown to
                perk brain power, promote appetite control, deliver anxiety relief and help you sleep better.
            </p>
            <p id="ingredients">
                <strong>How does "inhalation" aromatherapy work?</strong><br /> As the name suggests, you inhale the aroma of a particular essential oil (or, more often, a blend of oils) selected because they have a curative effect on the problems you’re
                experiencing. French chemist Rene-Maurice Gattefosse coined the phrase in the 1930's. The idea is simple: because essential oils are “volatile” (meaning they generate vapors that float through the air), their molecules can enter your lungs
                when they’re inhaled, eventually making their way into your bloodstream. During inhalation, they also strike tiny, hair-like olfactory nerve receptors inside your nose. These receptors take them directly to your limbic system, the part
                of your brain that regulates unconscious metabolism, controls your stress responses and governs mental activity.
            </p>
            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>Do scientists consider aromatherapy effective?</strong><br /> Yes, many do. By the early 1900’s, essential oil aromatherapy had started to enjoy popularity and respect among scientists and physicians. For example, in the 1920's,
                Italian scientists documented its bacteria-destroying capability as well as its ability to impact the nervous system. During the 1940's, French physician Dr. Jean Valnet used essential oil aromatherapy (in ointment form) to disinfect and
                heal war injuries. Over the past 20 years, clinical research has started to show the effectiveness of this healing approach. Reputable studies have looked at problems ranging from food cravings to insomnia, anxiety, depression and even
                addiction; and data shows that essential oil aromatherapy can be an effective aide to treatment.

                <strong>Is RELAX safe for everyone?</strong><br /> RELAX relieves stress and tension without making you sleepy or “fuzzy brained.” It won’t interfere with professional performance or make you feel disconnected from your emotions. It simply
                balances your system and helps you to look at issues without becoming fretful. RELAX does contain essential oil of bergamot which should not be used in large amounts during pregnancy. If you are expecting a baby and want to use the product,
                be sure to check with your doctor or midwife. Also, people with asthma and other respiratory ailments should start by using smaller amounts of any essential oil. Then gradually increase if no adverse reaction occurs. Finally, Children
                under 5 should not use any aromatherapy blend.
            </p>
            <p id="addictive">
                <strong>Can RELAX interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br /> No, essential oils do not interfere with prescription medication. Used by themselves, they can solve an occasional for even the healthiest people. For those with more
                significant health issues, essential oil aromatherapy can actually enhance the benefits of traditional medical care and prescription drugs.
