                <h3>Uses</h3>
                Here’s a fast, easy, and practical way to start building your own aromatherapy medicine cabinet. A cotton spine inside each inhaler is soaked in pure essential oils. When you place the inhaler under your nostrils and breathe deeply, the oils’ microscopic
                molecules make contact with tiny olfactory nerve receptors inside your nostrils. Those receptors instantly relay the molecules to your limbic system, the brain’s command center for emotions and metabolic function. This is the principle
                behind the ancient healing art of aromatherapy. Individual results may vary.

                <strong>What exactly is aromatherapy? </strong>
                <br /> Essential oil aromatherapy is an ancient healing art that uses botanical sap (extracted from blossoms, leaves, bark and roots) to restore balance to the body, mind and emotions. It is based on the premise that your body’s natural
                state is balance. Illness or upset occur when that balance is disrupted by poor lifestyle habits or an environmental contaminant. Among its many benefits, aromatherapy has been scientifically shown to perk brain power, promote appetite
                control, deliver anxiety relief and help you sleep better.
            </p>
            <p id="howoften">
                <strong>How does "inhalation" aromatherapy work?</strong>
                <br /> As the name suggests, you inhale the aroma of a particular essential oil because it has been shown to have a curative effect on a health imbalance that you’re experiencing. French chemist Rene-Maurice Gattefosse coined the phrase
                in the 1930's. The idea is simple: because essential oils are “volatile” (meaning they generate vapors that float through the air), their molecules can enter your lungs when they’re inhaled, eventually making their way into your bloodstream.
                During inhalation, they also strike tiny, hair-like olfactory nerve receptors inside your nose. These receptors take them directly to your limbic system, the part of your brain that regulates unconscious metabolism, controls your stress
                responses and governs mental activity. Of course, trained aromatherapists rely on hundreds of oils, used alone or in combination. However there are about 20 most useful essential oils that can become your family-friendly medicine cabinet
                for everyday health problems.
            </p>
            <p id="ingredients">
                <strong>So how do you use AromaWorks Pocket Inhalers? </strong>
                <br /> It’s easy. You unscrew the cap, place the inhaler below one nostril and inhale once or twice. Since your olfactory nerve receptors cannot cross from one side of the brain to the other, inhaling through your right nostril affects
                only your right brain. Experts know that each side of the brain affects different aspects of health and well-being. So you can maximize benefit by inhaling first through one nostril and then the other.
            </p>
            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>Do scientists consider aromatherapy effective?</strong>
                <br /> Yes, many do. By the early 1900’s, essential oil aromatherapy had started to enjoy popularity and respect among scientists and physicians. For example, in the 1920's, Italian scientists documented its bacteria-destroying capability
                as well as its ability to impact the nervous system. During the 1940's, French physician Dr. Jean Valnet used essential oil aromatherapy (in ointment form) to disinfect and heal war injuries. Over the past 20 years, clinical research has
                started to show the effectiveness of this healing approach. Reputable studies have looked at problems ranging from food cravings to insomnia, anxiety, depression and even addiction; and data shows that essential oil aromatherapy can be
                an effective aide to treatment.
            </p>
            <p id="howlong">
                <strong>Can the inhalers interfere with prescription drugs?</strong>
                <br /> No, essential oils do not interfere with prescription medication. Used by themselves, they can solve an occasional problems for even the healthiest people. For those with more significant health issues, essential oil aromatherapy
                can actually enhance the benefits of traditional medical care and prescription drugs. For example, when properly combined, essential oils can be a wonderful addition to hormone replacement therapy, anti-depression regimens and healthy
                diet plans.
            </p>
            <p id="addictive">
                <strong>Are essential oils safe for everyone? </strong>
                <br /> Some oils should not be used during pregnancy: basil, cinnamon, clove, eucalyptus, fennel, hyssop, juniper, lemon, marjoram, myrrh, pennyroyal, rosemary, sage, thyme, wintergreen and large amounts of peppermint. Also, people with
                asthma and other respiratory ailments should start by using smaller amounts of any essential oil. Then gradually increase if no adverse reaction occurs. Finally, Children under 5 should not use any aromatherapy blend.
