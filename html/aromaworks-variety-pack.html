                <h3>Uses</h3>
                Be sure to include this set of 4 aromatherapy inhalers in your essential oil medicine cabinet. A cotton spine inside each one is soaked in pure essential oils. When you place the inhaler under your nostrils and breathe deeply, the oils’ microscopic molecules
                make contact with tiny olfactory nerve receptors inside your nostrils. Those receptors instantly relay the molecules to your limbic system, the brain’s command center for emotions and metabolic function. This is the principle behind the
                ancient healing art of aromatherapy. Individual results may vary.

                <strong>What is the AromaWorks Variety Pack?</strong><br /> It’s a kit of 4 easy-to-carry aromatherapy remedies. Inside each “pocket inhaler” is a cotton spine soaked in a unique blend of essential oils. Safe and non-habit forming, each
                formula has been carefully formulated to correct a specific physical or emotional imbalance. Whether the goal is insomnia help, appetite control, anxiety relief or an all-natural stimulant – this Variety Pack puts the power of clinically-tested
                aromatherapy at your fingertips.
            </p>
            <p id="whoshould">
                <strong>What exactly is aromatherapy? </strong><br /> Essential oil aromatherapy is an ancient healing art that uses botanical sap (extracted from blossoms, leaves, bark and roots) to restore balance to the body, mind and emotions. It
                is based on the premise that your body’s natural state is balance. Illness or upset occur when that balance is disrupted by poor lifestyle habits or an environmental contaminant. Among its many benefits, aromatherapy has been scientifically
                shown to perk brain power, promote appetite control, deliver anxiety relief and help you sleep better.
            </p>
            <p id="howoften">
                <strong>How does "inhalation" aromatherapy work?</strong><br /> It’s easy. You unscrew the cap, place the inhaler below one nostril and inhale once or twice. Since your olfactory nerve receptors cannot cross from one side of the brain
                to the other, inhaling through your right nostril affects only your right brain. Experts know that each side of the brain affects different aspects of health and well-being. So you can maximize benefit by inhaling first through one nostril
                and then the other.
            </p>
            <p id="ingredients">
                <strong>So how do you use Pocket Inhalers?  </strong><br /> Every ingredient in this herbal pain relief blend is approved by the FDA. The most powerful ingredient is extra-pure imported menthol. Natural wintergreen, eucalyptus and peppermint
                oils are added to enhance the therapeutic benefits and to lend a refreshing aroma. Then a variety of herbal moisturizers are blended in, to help protect skin from dryness. All-herbal Pain Spray is never greasy. It won't stain skin or fabrics.

                <strong>Do scientists consider aromatherapy effective?</strong><br /> Yes, many do. By the early 1900’s, essential oil aromatherapy had started to enjoy popularity and respect among scientists and physicians. For example, in the 1920's,
                Italian scientists documented its bacteria-destroying capability as well as its ability to impact the nervous system. During the 1940's, French physician Dr. Jean Valnet used essential oil aromatherapy (in ointment form) to disinfect and
                heal war injuries. Over the past 20 years, clinical research has started to show the effectiveness of this healing approach. Reputable studies have looked at problems ranging from food cravings to insomnia, anxiety, depression and even
                addiction; and data shows that essential oil aromatherapy can be an effective aide to treatment.

            <p id="addictive">
                <strong>Can the inhalers interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br /> No, essential oils do not interfere with prescription medication. Used by themselves, they can solve an occasional problems for even the healthiest people. For
                those with more significant health issues, essential oil aromatherapy can actually enhance the benefits of traditional medical care and prescription drugs. For example, when properly combined, essential oils can be a wonderful addition
                to hormone replacement therapy, anti-depression regimens and healthy diet plans.
            </p>
            <p id="interfere">
                <strong>Are essential oils safe for everyone? </strong><br /> Some oils should not be used during pregnancy: basil, cinnamon, clove, eucalyptus, fennel, hyssop, juniper, lemon, marjoram, myrrh, pennyroyal, rosemary, sage, thyme, wintergreen
                and large amounts of peppermint. Also, people with asthma and other respiratory ailments should start by using smaller amounts of any essential oil. Then gradually increase if no adverse reaction occurs. Finally, Children under 5 should
                not use any aromatherapy blend.
