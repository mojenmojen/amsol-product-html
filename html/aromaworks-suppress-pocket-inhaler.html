                <h3>Uses</h3>
                Include SUPPRESS Pocket Inhaler in your essential oil medicine cabinet. The internal cotton spine comes soaked in pure essential oils. When you place the inhaler under your nostrils and breathe deeply, the oils’ microscopic molecules make contact with
                tiny olfactory nerve receptors inside your nostrils. Those receptors instantly relay the molecules to your limbic system, the brain’s command center for emotions and metabolic function. This is the principle behind the ancient healing
                art of aromatherapy. Individual results may vary.

            Studies show that almost half (47%) of American men have tried dieting to lose weight. Among women, make that three out of four (75%). Along with responsible eating, consider using the ancient art of aromatherapy to help maintain a healthy weight. With
            each whiff, this convenient AromaWorks SUPPRESS Pocket Inhaler delivers a mix of two essential oils, Grapefruit and Peppermint. Since your olfactory nerve receptors cannot cross from one side of the brain to the other, inhaling through your
            right nostril affects only your right brain. Experts know that each side of the brain affects different aspects of health and well-being. So you can maximize benefit by inhaling first through one nostril and then the other.
            <br />
            <br /> SUPPRESS is one of only a few aromatherapy formulas that can be used by almost anyone. Its simple but unique mix of grapefruit oil and essence of peppermint is a 100% safe and effective way to curb appetite, and to relieve the emotional
            and physical upset that often accompany the first few days of a cleanse or strict diet. Both ingredients are included in the most popular essential oils, but experts warn that children under 5 should not use any aromatherapy blend. In addition,
            people with asthma or any other respiratory ailment should start by using smaller amounts of an essential oil. Then gradually increase if no adverse reaction occurs.</div>

                <strong>How do you use the SUPPRESS Pocket Inhaler? </strong><br /> It’s easy. You unscrew the cap, place the inhaler below one nostril and inhale once or twice. Since your olfactory nerve receptors cannot cross from one side of the brain
                to the other, inhaling through your right nostril affects only your right brain. Experts know that each side of the brain affects different aspects of health and well-being. So you can maximize benefit by inhaling first through one nostril
                and then the other.</p>
            <p id="howoften">
                <strong>HWhat exactly is aromatherapy? </strong><br /> Essential oil aromatherapy is an ancient healing art that uses botanical sap (extracted from blossoms, leaves, bark and roots) to restore balance to the body, mind and emotions. It
                is based on the premise that your body’s natural state is balance. Illness or upset occur when that balance is disrupted by poor lifestyle habits or a contaminant. Among its many benefits, aromatherapy has been scientifically shown to
                perk brain power, promote appetite control, deliver anxiety relief and help you sleep better.
            </p>
            <p id="ingredients">
                <strong>How does "inhalation" aromatherapy work? </strong><br /> As the name suggests, you inhale the aroma of a particular essential oil (or, more often, a blend of oils) selected because they have a curative effect on the problems you’re
                experiencing. French chemist Rene-Maurice Gattefosse coined the phrase in the 1930's. The idea is simple: because essential oils are “volatile” (meaning they generate vapors that float through the air), their molecules can enter your lungs
                when they’re inhaled, eventually making their way into your bloodstream. During inhalation, they also strike tiny, hair-like olfactory nerve receptors inside your nose. These receptors take them directly to your limbic system, the part
                of your brain that regulates unconscious metabolism, controls your stress responses and governs mental activity.

            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>Do scientists consider aromatherapy effective?</strong><br /> Yes, many do. By the early 1900’s, essential oil aromatherapy had started to enjoy popularity and respect among scientists and physicians. For example, in the 1920's,
                Italian scientists documented its bacteria-destroying capability as well as its ability to impact the nervous system. During the 1940's, French physician Dr. Jean Valnet used essential oil aromatherapy (in ointment form) to disinfect and
                heal war injuries. Over the past 20 years, clinical research has started to show the effectiveness of this healing approach. Reputable studies have looked at problems ranging from food cravings to insomnia, anxiety, depression and even
                addiction; and data shows that essential oil aromatherapy can be an effective aide to treatment.

                <strong>Is SUPPRESS safe for everyone?</strong><br /> Yes, in fact SUPPRESS is one of only a few aromatherapy formulas that can be used by almost anyone. Children under 5 should not use any aromatherapy blend. And people with asthma or
                any other respiratory ailment should start by using smaller amounts of an essential oil. Then gradually increase if no adverse reaction occurs.
            </p>
            <p id="addictive">
                <strong>Can SUPPRESS interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br /> No, essential oils do not interfere with prescription medication. Used by themselves, they can solve an occasional for even the healthiest people. For those with more
                significant health issues, essential oil aromatherapy can actually enhance the benefits of traditional medical care and prescription drugs.
