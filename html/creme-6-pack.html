                <strong>What is Crème de la Femme? </strong><br /> Crème de la Femme is an all-natural vaginal lubricant. Developed by a woman doctor and trusted by women for over 30 years, it is a luxurious yet ultra-sheer vaginal cream that leaves protective,
                silky moisture on intimate tissue – giving instant relief from uncomfortable vaginal dryness, no matter why it happens.
            </p>
            <p id="whoshould">
                <strong>What are the causes of vaginal dryness?</strong><br /> Anytime a woman’s estrogen hormone level gets too low, the result is vaginal dryness. If delicate intimate tissue stays dry too long, it can become painful. Over time, vaginal
                irritation and infection can occur. Estrogen can diminish for many reasons. Menopause is the most common cause. So by age 50, more than 80% of women are beginning to live with uncomfortable dryness. But low estrogen can happen earlier
                so the other common reasons for vaginal dryness include breastfeeding, extreme exhaustion or prolonged stress, chemotherapy, ovarian dysfunction, birth control pills and even eating disorders.
            </p>
            <p id="howoften">
                <strong>How does Crème de la Femme work?  </strong><br /> It works a lot like a rich, luxurious facial moisturizer. It protects tissue with an ultra-thin layer of “fluid-film” lubrication and slows down the vaginal atrophy (tissue shrinkage)
                that is a normal part of aging. Of course, only prescription hormone can replenish estrogen. In recent years, however, concern over the medical risks associated with traditional hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has led to new, innovative
                approaches. Crème de la Femme is one of them – because it relieves dryness without relying on hormone additives, harsh ingredients or parabens.
            </p>
            <p id="ingredients">
                <strong>How often should Crème de la Femme be used?</strong><br /> Because Crème de la Femme is made exclusively from natural ingredients, it can be applied as often as desired. For all-day comfort, some women apply it externally after
                their bath or shower. Others prefer to use the thin applicator that comes sealed in every box, to apply the lubricant internally. You will probably want to apply daily, at least initially, to replenish moisture and stop vaginal irritation.
                Eventually, you may find that you can use less lubricant, less often. In addition, most women re-apply before intercourse. Crème de la Femme is self-cleansing, so it leaves no messy residue and never requires follow-up douching.
            </p>
            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>What are the ingredients in Crème de la Femme?</strong><br /> Crème de la Femme is a blend of extremely pure, pharmaceutical-grade mineral oil, petrolatum, paraffin and ceresin. So Crème de la Femme is an oil-based vaginal lubricant
                that remains semi-solid at room temperature. Then the instant it touches warm skin, it melts into silky moisture. Unlike other vaginal lubricants, Crème de la Femme contains no alcohol, dyes or glycerin. All ingredients used in the formula
                are FDA monographed and registered.
            </p>
            <p id="howlong">
                <strong>Who formulated Crème de la Femme?</strong><br /> Marilynn Pratt, MD, spent over five years developing and testing Crème de la Femme. She started the project because so many of her own patients complained about menopausal vaginal
                dryness and the need for a safe, elegant remedy. Since 1986, when Dr. Pratt introduced the product to the general public, countless women nationwide have come to depend on it.
            </p>
            <p id="addictive">
                <strong>Can Crème de la Femme cause vaginal infection?</strong><br /> No. In fact, Crème de la Femme actually helps protect against yeast infection. Here’s why: most vaginal lubricants are water-based products and water is a breeding ground
                for yeast. Because Crème de la Femme is an oil-based lubricant, it moisturizes without contributing to yeast growth. In addition, because it’s oil-based, it doesn’t run or dry up fast. Protection lasts for hours, lowering your risk of
                abrasion, bladder infection & vaginal irritation. Finally, because Crème de la Femme contains no glycerin (a form of sugar), it is safe even for women with diabetes and other blood sugar variances. Put simply, Crème de la Femme never exposes
                women to the dangers associated with of some lubricants.
            </p>
            <p id="interfere">
                <strong>Will Crème de la Femme interfere with prescription drugs? </strong><br /> Because it is not a drug, Crème de la Femme does not interfere with the efficacy of any prescription drug. It can be used by women undergoing chemotherapy.
                It is safe to use while taking birth control pills. Many women on traditional hormone replacement therapy, and even bio-identical hormones, still combat a degree of vaginal dryness. They too can use Crème de la Femme for some extra, soothing
                relief.
            </p>
            <p id="rollon">
                <strong>Can Crème de la Femme be used with condoms?  </strong><br /> Crème de la Femme can be safely used with polyurethane or natural lamb’s skin condoms. It is not recommended for use with latex condoms because the oils in the lubricant
                can deteriorate the latex.
            </p>
            <p id="dangerous">
                <strong>Is oral sex dangerous when using Crème de la Femme? </strong><br /> Absolutely not! Crème De La Femme has no flavor, so your partner won’t taste anything. Because it’s an oil-based lubricant, he might feel a slightly oily residue
                sensation. But there is nothing in the product that is dangerous, even if swallowed in small amounts.

                "I would not want to live without it. I was put on estrogen cream and six weeks later ended up in the ER with extremely high blood pressure. At that point I was told to get off the estrogen cream and then suffered from itching & dryness. I researched
                alternatives, found Crème de la Femme and have used it since with NO side effects whatsoever, only relief. I'm a satisfied customer forever."<br />

                <br /> "Initially, my gynecologist gave me a sample and encouraged me to try it. From the first application, I knew that Crème de la Femme was exceptional. It didn't run like other lubricants do. It never feels sticky. Really, you don't
                even realize it's there until you need it and then what a difference it makes!"<br />

                <br /> "After the birth of my first baby it really helped relieve uncomfortable dryness. I love it and my husband does, too."<br />
                <br /> "My doctor gave me a sample of Crème de la Femme and it worked in 1 hour! I have suffered with dryness for months at a time and have spent hundreds of dollars on various lubricants. But when I tried Crème de la Femme, it actually
                worked."

                <br /> "I tried a few lubricants but disliked all the chemical ingredients. Then my nurse practitioner suggested Crème de la Femme. I tried it and now rely on it. I would never use anything else. It's exactly what I was looking for."<br
                />
                <br /> DOCTOR: "As a physician I can attest to the fact that Crème de la Femme is sensually superb and esthetically superior to other lubricants."<br />
                <br /> PHARMACIST: "We've carried Crème de la Femme at the pharmacy for many years with very high customer appreciation. We recommend it and will continue to do so because it really works."<br />
                <br /> DOCTOR: "Crème de la Femme is a miracle for my patients with dryness!"<br />
                <br /> "It's always soothing. It never irritates me in the least. I use it frequently."<br />
                <br /> "I was diagnosed by my gynecologist with vaginal atrophy and now use a low dose estrogen cream weekly. Still, it doesn't always provide enough moisture so it's great to know I can use Crème de la Femme anytime I need it!"<br />

                <br /> "I want you to know how pleased I am with Crème de la Femme. Earlier today, I felt a little uncomfortable so I applied some and was amazed! Immediately, I felt so much better."<br />

                <br /> "After many months of searching for a solution to my discomfort, this product restored a natural feeling. I think all moms should tell their daughters about this product for their future reference."<br />
                <br /> "It is all natural and this is what I like best about this product."<br />
                <br /> DOCTOR: "I was somewhat hesitant to suggest Crème de la Femme because I've always told my patients to avoid any lubricant that is not water soluble. Nevertheless, I have offered it to several of our patients and their response has
                been quite positive (even enthusiastic) and despite my concerns, your product has not yet resulted in any increase in vaginal infections. So please send me additional samples and brochures!"<br />
                <br /> "I've tried similar products but none of them compare with Crème de la Femme."</div>
