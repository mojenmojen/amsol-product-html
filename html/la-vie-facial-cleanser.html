            La Vie en C Facial Cleanser is a pure, gentle, but effective liquid “soap” that eliminates superficial dirt and environmental contaminants while nourishing the skin with ingredients that make it look and feel healthy. Organic rosehip seed oil and fruit
            extract, vitamins C, vitamin E, chamomile, and rosemary extract supply powerful antioxidants and nutrients to neutralize free radicals and promote a brighter, calmer, more youthful complexion. Manufactured exclusively in small batches, under
            the strictest quality-control standards, every bottle contains a handmade blend of natural ingredients.<br />
            <br /> La Vie en C Facial Cleanser has been formulated with “stabilized vitamin C” (as ascorbic acid), the newest breakthrough in modern skincare science. Dermatologists and aestheticians have known for years that vitamin C could diminish
            the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production, and improve the skin’s texture and elasticity. The problem has been an inability to keep vitamin C fresh and active. But La Vie en C has moved beyond this barrier, offering
            a long-lasting and pure facial soap infused with powerful skin-enhancing ingredients as well as antioxidants and nutrients to protect the skin and keep it looking its best.<br />
            <br /> Women and men of all ages can benefit from La Vie en C Facial Cleanser because it cleans without over-stripping the natural oils that hydrate and protect the skin. Women like the combination of a revolutionary cleanser and anti-aging
            skin “food”. Plus, this Facial Cleanser is ideal for mature skin, so it can be a trusted part of every woman’s anti-aging skincare regimen. La Vie en C Facial Cleanser also addresses the unique needs of male skin, and almost instantly calms
            the redness and discomfort of razor burn. In fact, it makes an ideal shaving lotion because its nourishing ingredients soothe facial tissue as the razor travels along the surface skin. It helps with acne-prone skin. Even ideal for people with
            eczema, psoriasis and other skin sensitivity issues.<br />
            <br /> For best results, cleanse twice a day. Use La Vie en C Facial Cleanser in the morning to clean away the oil, dirt and bacteria that inevitably accumulate overnight. Use it in the evening to wash away make-up, daily grime and pollutants.
            You can wash your face with your fingertips, making sure that your hands are clean. Or use a clean washcloth that has been soaked in lukewarm water. Don’t over-scrub. Take care to avoid the eye area. Rinse well. Pat skin dry with a soft, clean
            towel. Follow with you choice of toner, serum and/or moisturizer.</div>

                "I have very sensitive and dry skin so I'm always skeptical about trying anything new on my face. I have to say La Vie En C did wonders to my skin! I’ve been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin feels moisturized, soft and healthy. I couldn’t be happier
                with the results!"<br />
                <br /> "Being able to see results in a short period of time was a big plus for me. My skin looked brighter the morning after I first used the Serum! After 2-3 weeks, I noticed that the lines right above my upper lip and on my forehead
                looked much softer."<br />
                <br /> "I use the Serum as an after-shave every day to avoid razor burn and small pimples on my chin and neck."<br />
                <br /> "La Vie en C is the only thing that touches my skin! Being an esthetician, I've tried so many product lines but nothing else competes with the purity of their ingredients or quality of skin results they deliver. The Facial Cleanser
                is my favorite! Leaves my skin feeling so clean but completed hydrated."<br />
                <br /> "After being a longtime devotee of a very expensive line of skincare, I was dubious about trying this less costly Moisturizer Serum. But my doubts are definitely gone! After a few weeks of using La Vie en C Serum, my skin is smoother,
                softer, and more nourished than ever. Thank you for improving my skin and saving me money. Hooray!"<br />
                <br /> "I have super sensitive skin, prone to eczema and general irritation. Even the celebrity creams will give me a rash or redness. Complicating matters is that I have very dry skin and my eyes are easily irritated by facial products.
                Over the years, I've tried several moisturizers to help with all this. It's been an unpleasant rollercoaster of buying expensive (sometimes outrageously expensive) products, only to give them away to friends because they just didn't work
                for me. Then, I discovered La Vie En C. I have been using this remarkable line of skincare products for over a year now, and I absolutely love it. I'm able to keep my skin clean and cared for, feeling moisturized and enriched, with just
                their Cleanser and Serum. Amazing stuff! They really have reduced the lines on my face. It's like a time machine in a bottle!"<br />
                <br /> "Now in my 80’s I went bald at a young age, years before sunblock was advised. I suffered numerous sunburns while golfing, lawn mowing, etc. and the last couple of years required surgery to remove several melanomas from my scalp.
                This left me with scarring and sandpaper rough skin. I’ve never been one for lotions or moisturizers, but my daughter urged me to try La Vie n C. Mostly to humor her, I did – but with amazing results. The scarring is now barely visible
                and my sandpaper skin now feels like a baby’s ----. I can hardly believe it myself."<br />
                <br /> "I LOVE both the Cleanser and Serum. I use them twice a day and they’ve definitely improved the texture of my skin and seem to have calmed my tendency toward redness. The fine lines around my mouth appear less pronounced and two
                small age marks on my check have definitely lightened. I can’t say enough good things. I’m hooked! Thanks so much!"<br />
                <br /> "I am a man in my 60's, and I have some wrinkles on my forehead and a little 'stress knot' between my eyebrows. This serum goes on smoothly in the morning, and dries relatively quickly. This is important because I don't want to
                have a big regimen everyday - I just wouldn't make time for it. I've noticed the horizontal lines in my forehead are reduced, and the stress knot also appears more relaxed. I am continuing to use the product and would recommend it as I
                am quite happy with the results so far."
