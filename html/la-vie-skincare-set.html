            all-day hydration without leaving skin greasy. Perfect for all skin types. Ideal for acne-prone skin, adult rosacea, eczema or psoriasis. Save $4.00 OFF the everyday price on both formulas.<br />
            <div class="asTab asSubsection">
                <h3>Uses</h3>
                Cleanser: With its mega-dose of vitamin C, this age-defying facial cleanser promotes healthier, brighter, younger-looking skin. By lifting away oil and dirt, it diminishes the appearance of blackheads and patchy breakout on the chin, along the hairline,
                and across the nose. Packed with powerful herbal ingredients, it helps reduce the red and inflamed look of acne-prone teenage skin and adult rosacea. Infused with calming lavender and rosehip fruit extract, it soothes and moisturizes the
                skin after shaving to prevent rash and razor burn.<br />
                <br /> Serum: This revolutionary stabilized vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) formula helps prevent signs of facial aging and keeps young skin looking firm and supple for as long as possible. Decreases the look of sagging skin, fine lines,
                coarse wrinkling, dark under-eye circles, and age spots (hyperpigmentation). Also a soothing moisturizer for acne-prone skin and rosacea. Calms the redness of a ruddy complexion. Even combats the damaging effects of sun exposure and outdoor
                free radicals.

            This is a science-based skincare regimen scaled down to just 2 formulas. (1) A pure and highly effective liquid “soap” that cleans the skin while also nourishing it with ingredients that promote collagen production, elasticity and radiance. (2) A highly-concentrated
            serum that contains vitamins, antioxidants and nutrients to improve the look and feel of all skin types. Instead of the traditional 4-step regimen of cleanser-toner-serum-moisturizer, these two products offer both women and men a complete,
            affordable, all-natural skincare system.<br />
            <br /> Because it utilizes the newest and most revolutionary breakthrough in skincare science – “stabilized vitamin C” (as ascorbic acid). Dermatologists and aestheticians have known for years that vitamin C could diminish the appearance of
            fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production, improve skin texture, and enhance elasticity. The problem has been an inability to keep vitamin C fresh and active for more than a few weeks. La Vie en C has overcome this barrier, offering
            an exclusive line of long-lasting formulas that hydrate the skin and diminish visible signs of aging.<br />
            <br /> Absolutely anyone can improve their complexion with this skincare system. That’s true for men as well as women, regardless of age. Both formulas help keep young skin looking great longer. Also perfect for mature skin because the formulas
            can smooth uneven skin tone, brighten under-eye darkness, lighten age spots, and minimize the look of saggy skin. For women, the products work like a daily mini-lift. Men appreciate this fast, no-fuss approach to male skincare. Fragrance-free,
            the cleanser and serum soothe their face before and after shaving to prevent razor burn and rash. Blended entirely without greasy ingredients, the products never create a shiny complexion. They never leave a sticky residue to clog pores. This
            makes them ideal for acne-prone skin. Safe even for people with eczema, psoriasis and other skin-sensitivity issues.<br />
            <br /> For best results, use the Facial Cleanser twice a day. In the morning, to clean away the oil, dirt, and bacteria that inevitably accumulate overnight. At night, to wash away make-up, daily grime and pollutants. Take care to avoid the
            eye area. Don’t over-scrub, and always rinse well. Then pat skin dry with a soft, clean towel. The Moisturizer Serum is highly concentrated and ultra-active, so it takes very little product to achieve desired results. One application daily,
            before bed, may be enough for young, non-problematic skin. For more mature or highly sensitive skin, it is best to apply twice a day, morning and evening.

                <strong>How often should the formulas be used?</strong><br />For best results, use the <strong>Moisturizing Facial Soap</strong> twice a day. In the morning, to clean away the oil, dirt, and bacteria that inevitably accumulate overnight.
                At night, to wash away make-up, daily grime and pollutants. Take care to avoid the eye area. Don’t over-scrub, and always rinse well. Then pat skin dry with a soft, clean towel. The <strong>Moisturizer Serum </strong>is highly concentrated

            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>Can the formulas be used separately? </strong><br />Yes. However, they were developed as a 2-formula skincare system. So, for maximum benefit, they should be used together.
            </p>
            <p id="howlong">
                <strong>What ingredients are in the two formulas? </strong><br />Both formulas are 100% free of dangerous ingredients found in many of today’s skincare products. No phthalates, parabens, dyes, or added fragrances. <strong>The Moisturizing Facial
                Soap</strong> contains distilled water, vegetable glycerin, potassium hydroxide (used for saponification only), saponified organic coconut oil, saponified organic olive oil, Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), Rosa canina (rosehip) seed oil
                & fruit extract, Matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract, d-alpha Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, and Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) essential oil. The <strong>Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum </strong>contains
                distilled Water, olive leaf extract, matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract, Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), organic vegetable glycerin, Rosa mosqueta (rosehip) fruit extract, Calophyllum inophyllum (tamanu) seed oil, Siegesbeckia orientali

            <p id="moisturizer">
                <strong>Should I use a moisturizer after these products?</strong><br />Dry skin does need ample moisture. So it would be wise to add extra protective hydration with a daily moisturizer. Be careful to choose a chemical-free product. Wash
                face with La Vie en C Moisturizing Facial Soap. Immediately apply the Moisturizer Serum. Then allow 15 minutes for the serum to be fully absorbed before adding your moisturizer.

                "I have very sensitive and dry skin so I'm always skeptical about trying anything new on my face. I have to say La Vie En C did wonders to my skin! I’ve been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin feels moisturized, soft and healthy. I couldn’t be happier
                with the results!"<br />
                <br /> "Being able to see results in a short period of time was a big plus for me. My skin looked brighter the morning after I first used the Serum! After 2-3 weeks, I noticed that the lines right above my upper lip and on my forehead
                looked much softer."<br />
                <br /> "I use the Serum as an after-shave every day to avoid razor burn and small pimples on my chin and neck."<br />
                <br /> "La Vie en C is the only thing that touches my skin! Being an esthetician, I've tried so many product lines but nothing else competes with the purity of their ingredients or quality of skin results they deliver. The Facial Cleanser
                is my favorite! Leaves my skin feeling so clean but completed hydrated."<br />
                <br /> "After being a longtime devotee of a very expensive line of skincare, I was dubious about trying this less costly Moisturizer Serum. But my doubts are definitely gone! After a few weeks of using La Vie en C Serum, my skin is smoother,
                softer, and more nourished than ever. Thank you for improving my skin and saving me money. Hooray!"<br />
                <br /> "I have super sensitive skin, prone to eczema and general irritation. Even the celebrity creams will give me a rash or redness. Complicating matters is that I have very dry skin and my eyes are easily irritated by facial products.
                Over the years, I've tried several moisturizers to help with all this. It's been an unpleasant rollercoaster of buying expensive (sometimes outrageously expensive) products, only to give them away to friends because they just didn't work
                for me. Then, I discovered La Vie En C. I have been using this remarkable line of skincare products for over a year now, and I absolutely love it. I'm able to keep my skin clean and cared for, feeling moisturized and enriched, with just
                their Cleanser and Serum. Amazing stuff! They really have reduced the lines on my face. It's like a time machine in a bottle!"<br />
                <br /> "Now in my 80’s I went bald at a young age, years before sunblock was advised. I suffered numerous sunburns while golfing, lawn mowing, etc. and the last couple of years required surgery to remove several melanomas from my scalp.
                This left me with scarring and sandpaper rough skin. I’ve never been one for lotions or moisturizers, but my daughter urged me to try La Vie n C. Mostly to humor her, I did – but with amazing results. The scarring is now barely visible
                and my sandpaper skin now feels like a baby’s ----. I can hardly believe it myself."<br />
                <br /> "I LOVE both the Cleanser and Serum. I use them twice a day and they’ve definitely improved the texture of my skin and seem to have calmed my tendency toward redness. The fine lines around my mouth appear less pronounced and two
                small age marks on my check have definitely lightened. I can’t say enough good things. I’m hooked! Thanks so much!"<br />
                <br /> "I am a man in my 60's, and I have some wrinkles on my forehead and a little 'stress knot' between my eyebrows. This serum goes on smoothly in the morning, and dries relatively quickly. This is important because I don't want to
                have a big regimen everyday - I just wouldn't make time for it. I've noticed the horizontal lines in my forehead are reduced, and the stress knot also appears more relaxed. I am continuing to use the product and would recommend it as I
                am quite happy with the results so far."
